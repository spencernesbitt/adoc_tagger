= Configuration for tagger
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== What are we trying to achieve from the configuration?

. We need to know wher we should put or find stuff:
.. The stuff:
*** The Overall Tag index file
+
This this the main index for the tags and includes links to all the tag files.
*** The Tag files
+
By default, these will be placed in the same folder as the .adoc file but we might want to make this configurable
*** Probably the templates for the tag inserts etc.
*** Casing
**** camel
**** snake
**** kebab
**** etc.


== Example config file

[source, json]
.tagger-conf.json
{
    "tagindex": "./tag-index.adoc", // the index file is in the same folder as ths config
}
